Use notes for review:
This project uses Bootstrap, chart.js and node.js. 

It features 4 of the functions listed in the project requirements and 1 not listed. 

Please begin on index.html. This is the registration page. 

Of the required functions: 

(1) "Create and use a function that accepts two or more values (parameters), calculates or determines a new value based on those inputs, and returns a new value"

This is demonstrated on the personality quiz page. User input is collected and calculated. The new value is the result of quiz answers and generates a score that falls within ranges determining tree personality. 


(2) "Build a conversion tool that converts user input to another type and displays it (ex: converts cups to grams)" 

This is demonstrated in the board foot calculator. The user provides information which is fed to converter.js. User size is converted to board feet and displayed to user. 

(3) "Calculate and display data based on an external factor (ex: get the current date, and display how many days remaining until some event)"

This is demonstrated in "How Long Until Arbor Day". 

(4) "Visualize data in a graph, chart, or other visual representation of data"
